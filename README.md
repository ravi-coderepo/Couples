This is a POC for a growing chat solution with use of classification.
Application Goals:-

Birds of same feather flock together.
And
People of same likings CHAT together.


1.  Create a chat application for 10,000 people.
2.  These people will be distributed across
    different chat rooms.
3.  Chat rooms can be designated with different
    titles such as sports, drama, movie etc.
4.  People will be given flexibility to move across
    different chat rooms.
5.  People will be given recommendations to move to 
    different chat rooms based on their quantitative 
    chat reports.
6.  Size and number of chat rooms will be flexible.


Functional Assumptions:-

Any machine however smart, needs data to 
to function smartly.

1. Out of 10,000, atleast 1000 people will be asked to 
   fill in a form, where

a) They will mention only three things about themselves
   i.e age, sex, and sexual orientation.
b) They will mention multiple choices about their partner's
   likings. For ex- movie, hobby, education, sexual orientation,
   tourist destinations etc.
c) Based on these people will give their assumption as likelihood
   of their partnership in the binomial form of 1 or 0.

2. Out 1000; 5 group of 200 people each will be generated, by taking
   the commonality of movie, hobby, sexual orientation to start with.
3. Next incoming 9000 people will be distributed in these groups
   based on classification based machined learning algorithms.
4. 


Technical Goals:-

1.  These people will be distributed across
    different chat rooms.
2.  People will be given flexibility to move across
